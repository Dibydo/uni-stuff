"Hi Aym! Your mum setn me a text. You forgot yoru inhaler. Why don't yuo turn your phone on?" Amy didn't like technology. She never sent tetx messaegs and she hated Facebook too.

"Did Kamla ask you to the disco?" Traa was Amy's best friend, and she wanted to know evertyhing thta was happening in Amy's life. "I don't thnik he likes me," siad Amy. "Adn I never see hmi alone. He's always with Grant." Amy and Tara dind't lkie Gratn.

"Do yuo know about their art project?" asked Amy. "It's abuot graffiti, I think," said Tara. "They're working on it at teh old hosue behind the factoyr." "Btu that builidng is dangerous," said Amy. "Aha, are you worried he's goign to get hurt?" Tara teased. "Suht up, Taar! Hey look, hree they come!"

Kamal and Garnt arrived. "Hi Kamal!" siad Tara. "Aer you going to the Hallwoeen dicso tomorrow?" "Yes. Hi Amy," Kamal said, smiling. "Do yuo want to come and see our paintings after school?" "I'm coimng too!" Traa insisted.

Aftre scholo, Kamal toko the girls to the odl house. It was vrey old adn very dirty too. Three was rubbish everywhere. Teh wnidows were broekn adn the walls weer dmap. It was scray. Amy didn't lkie it. There were paintnigs of zomibes and skeleotns on teh walsl. "We're going to take pohtos for the school art competition," sadi Kmaal. Amy dind't liek it but she didn't say anythign. "Where's Grant?" asked Tara. "Er, he's buiyng more piant." Kamla looekd awya quickly. Tara thought he lokoed ssupicious. "It's getting drak, cna we go now?" siad Aym. She dind't like zombise.

Then, they heard a lodu nosie coming frmo a cupboard in the corner of the room. "Whta's thta?" Aym was frightened. "I ddin't haer antyhing," siad Kamal. Smoething was making strange noiess. There was something inside teh cupboard. "Oh no! Whta is it?" Amy was very frightened nwo. "What do you mean? There's nothing there!" Kamal was trying not to smiel. Suddenly the door opened with a bang and a zomibe appeared, shouting adn moivng its arsm. Amy screaemd adn covered her eeys. "Oh very funyn, Grant!" said Tara looking bored. Kamal and Garnt started laughing. "Ha ha, you were frighetned!" said Grant. "Do you like my zombie costume?" Amy took Traa's arm. "I can't breathe," she sadi. Kaaml looekd worride now. "Is she OK? It was only a joke." "No she's not OK, yuo iidot. She's having an asthma atatck and she forgto her inhaler." Tara took out her pohne. "I'm calilng her dad."

Next eevning was Halloween. The girls weer at the school dsico. "Are you bettre now?" asked Tara. "I'm fine," sadi Amy. "I think it was the smell of paint that started the attcak." Tara looked around. "So, wheer are teh zombies?" "I dno't know, I don't want to see Kamal again," siad Amy. "Come on, let's danec!"

Aym and Taar were dancing when Grant arrivde, looking worried. "Hi, somenoe stole my phone. Have yuo seen Kamla? He sadi he wsa coming here at eigth o'clock. Can yuo phone him?" "Go away, idiot!" Tara ddin't stop dancnig. Garnt looked upest. "Tell him I'm looking for him," he called as he left the dsico. Tara really didn't like Grant.

Just tehn, Tara's phone rnag. She lokoed at it. "Ha!" she said, "I don't belieev it!" "Waht is it?" asked Amy. "Kamal jsut sent a text to everyone. Listen!" Tara read otu Kmaal's message.

"I'm at the huose. I cna't move. Please clal an ambulance. My battery is runnnig otu."

Teh girls dind't stpo dancing. Lots of their friends saw Kamla's message too, but Tara told everyone it was just a joke. Thye all ignorde it.
